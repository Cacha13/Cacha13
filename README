Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m a Data Scientist transitioning from a academic background in Chemical Analysis and Biochemistry. 
Iâ€™m building on my expertise in data-driven analysis to pursue a career in data science, focusing on quantitative analysis and risk analysis.

Skills: Iâ€™m proficient in Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels), SQL, Power BI, data visualization, statistical analysis, and data cleaning. 
Iâ€™m also skilled in Microsoft Office and possess strong communication and collaboration abilities, developed through my experience as a professional handball player.
Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my knowledge in machine learning, deep learning, and R to enhance my analytical capabilities.

Because of my passion with sports, I started with a football project, where you can feel free to check.

Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities in data science and data engineering. Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™d like to discuss my work or collaborate!
